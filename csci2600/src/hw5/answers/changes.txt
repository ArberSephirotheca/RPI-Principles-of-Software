Made Edge class extend Comparable and implemented compareTo function.
	I made this change so I could use edges in a TreeSet and have them be automatically
	sorted by start, then end, then label. It also allowed me to remove/comment out the 
	equals and hashCode methods, which were far more likely to screw up and cause problems.

Made Graph store collection of edges as a TreeSet instead of a LinkedHashSet.
	The access speed to each edge is slightly slower, but a lot of the actual functionality
	comes from iterating through the whole edge list, which would be the same speed for 
	TreeSet and LinkedHashSet. The main reason I changed it though was so the edges would be
	sorted the path finding algorithm would always hit the correct nodes/edges first and 
	so any repeat node or edge can be disregarded without having to check if its ends and label
	are actually alphabetically before/after the previously discovered path.
