1. In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this homework?
	Go to office hours or something so I could have gotten suggestions/pointers for finding some of the
	invariants instead of just spending a long time being stuck myself, I guess? They were just hard/confusing invariants.
	
2. What could the Principles of Software staff have done better to improve your learning experience in this homework?
	It would be nice if there were more examples provided of invariants and strategies to find them, 
	particularly for various different types of loop setups (like nested loops, etc.)

3. What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the homework?
	Don't forget you can/should use the given/input variables (the ones that should remain constant) in the invariants.
	Also, include something similar to the loop condition in the invariant to make proving the specific value of 
	the exit condition much easier.
