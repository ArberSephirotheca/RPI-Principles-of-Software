1. In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this homework?
It would have helped if I had done more of the Dafny practice in class, as well as looking at/going
through more examples from the reading.

2. What could I (the instructor) have done better to improve your learning experience in this homework?
Dafny is useful, but their provided examples are not particularly helpful. It would be really nice
if in addition to just going through some in class, you posted some examples of questions fully in
Dafny code that we could pull up and reference while writing our own. This would help with any 
formatting quirks, as well as show us what type of thing you're looking for/how ours should look.

3. What do you know now that you wish you had known before beginning the homework?
The Dafny handbook/tutorial is actually really useful, and you should read it -BEFORE- starting the
problems and sitting staring at a webpage trying to figure out how to make Dafny do something for a long time.
