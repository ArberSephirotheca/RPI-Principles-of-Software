1. In one brief paragraph, describe your representation. For at least the three representations 
above and your representation (if it is not one of the ones above), explain an advantage of that 
representation in a sentence. Given these advantages, briefly explain why you chose the 
representation you did.
	My code represents the graph as a collection of edges together with a collection of nodes. 
	The collection of nodes allows quick and easy access and visualization of what nodes are in the
	graph, and the collection of edges refers to the nodes while providing extra information.
	
	Advantages of other representations:
	-As a collection of edges
		Allows for simple representation with minimal memory usage, and is easily visualizable.		
	-As an adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
		Makes keeping track of nodes and their children, as well as adding new nodes or edges, very fast and easy.
	-As an adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of edges,
	 whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.
		Allows the client to have information on all possible edges based on the current nodes, making
		it very fast and easy to add, check, or remove edges.
